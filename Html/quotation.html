            <h2>Html blockquote tag for Quotations</h2>
            <p>The HTML blockquote tag element defines a section that is quoted from another source.</p>
            <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
            <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
                For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation
                organization,
                WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to
                develop and
                deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.

            <h2>Html short quotation tag</h2>
            <p>The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.</p>
            <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
            <hr>

            <h2>Html abbreviation</h2>
            <p>The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP",
                    "ATM".<br>

                    Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and
                    search-engines.<br>

                    Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you
                    mouse over the element. </p>
            <p>Example</p><br>
            <p>The <abbr title="World Helth Organnisatioon">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>HTML address tag for Contact Information</h2>
            <p>The HTML
            <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.<br>

                The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media
                handle, etc.<br>

                The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break
                    before and after the <address> element.</p>
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        <address>
                            Written by Raygan Anand.<br>

                        <h2>Html city tag for Work Title</h2>
                        <p>The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a
                                movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc....).<br>

                                Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.<br>

                                The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.</p>
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>
